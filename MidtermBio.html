			<p>
			I was born Spring 1986, at North Central Hospital, to Lynette and Rudy Roberts. My parents were both immigrants to the United States (my mom being Antiguan and my Dad Jamaican). I resided in the Bronx until 1998, until I moved to the island of Antigua, and live there for three years. I attended three years of a foreign and unfamiliar education system which showed me a different form of learn. I returned to the Bronx in 2001 and attended Herbert H Lehman high school in the Bronx.
			</P> <!--end of first paragraph-->
			<p>
			During my senior year at Lehman, I decided I wanted something different than what was most of my peers did. January 2004, I spoke with Military recruiters from each branch of service. By November 2004 I made up my mind and on November 29 I shipped off to start my career as a Marine. For nine years, I worked as a Helicopter Airframes and Hydraulic Mechanic, and a Quality Assurance representative.  I served two tours to Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom(OEF), and receive a few medals and awards along the way.
			</p> <!--end of second paragraph-->
			<p>December 2013, was the end of my second enlistment and the start of a new experience. I decided to get out of the Marines (Honorably) and pursue a Career as an Information Technician (IT). On January 2014, I started my First semester at Fordham University where I will pursue Majoring in Information Technology and Systems (BS-ITS). I am currently in my senior year and expect to graduate this May.
